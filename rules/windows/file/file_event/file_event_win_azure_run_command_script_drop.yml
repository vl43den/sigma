    Detects creation of PowerShell scripts in the Azure Run Command plugin directory.
    According to Mandiant research, Azure Activity Logs do not capture script contents by default,
    making file monitoring critical for detecting malicious commands. Scripts are downloaded to
    a predictable path before execution, allowing detection of the actual malicious code being
    pushed to virtual machines via Azure Run Command.
    This rule triggers on script creation beyond the initial setup script (script0.ps1).
